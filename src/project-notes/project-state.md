- Understanding the structure and the flow from previous work

## Review from previous steps

- try to diplay directory to define the structure of link hierarcy in the client
  based on backend (server) directory
  This used to display the structure of markdown content

# 12/12/2024  - create template for logging

This is example logging to define the flow of the app 

```bash
âœ“ Compiled /personal-notes in 321ms (728 modules)
list of category:  [ 'python', 'TypeScript' ]
Slug: {}
slug from generateStaticParam: undefined
```

with this information, we have a lot of question

1. where is this code comes from?
2. what is the context of the code that resulting that log?
3. whas is the data flow of the code?
